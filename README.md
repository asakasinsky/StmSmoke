This is open-source STM32F373C8T6 based vaping mod. Everything is under GPL license (see LICENSE file).

Output power is up to 140 Watts (although you may need a cooler for FETs). 

Schematics and PCB gerber files in the PCB subdirectory. Soon there will be another PCB variant (with
the coil inductor, which stabilizes output power and up to 10000 temperature measures per second). It
is very recommended to use 4-layers PCB with ground plane filled in the middle (otherwise you may get
crosstalk to touch sensors).

The screen is 128x64 OLED 0.96" screen ($4 or so on aliexpress).

Other directories is Ecliplse Mars + GCC/ARM project. There is a lot of crap generated by
STM32CubeMX, main files is:

 include/smoke.h (important stuff, check before compile!)
 src/smoke.c (main code)

The project uses the u8glib library to interface with the screen ( https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib ).

Note, new version uses FDV304P p-fet as additional output MOSFET driver and inverted PWM output, will not
work with older hadrware (comment #define INVERTED_PWM_COIL in smoke.h)!
